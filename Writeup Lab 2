1. I note that as chain length increases, the acceptance rate decreases in what seems to be a negative log curve. This would make sense as when chain length increases, the chance that any two residues are overlapping increases.
2. Go Latice
In this case, the minimal energy is -24 corresponding to the starting state of the protein given. Initially, the energy of the system averages around -20.5, but as the temperature is lowered, the energy settles to -23 and remains constant. I attribute the significance of the -23 state to be that this is the energy that is balanced by the greatest entropy.
Random Protein
In the case of the random protein, the initial energy begins higher, and it takes more time for the protein to fold into a stable configuration, but when it settles, it does so at an energy of -24.
When the initial temperature is lowered, the energy of the protein almost instantly drops to -23 and stays there
This is because the temperature is no longer high enough to support a exploration of higher energy states.
3.Go Latice 2
Similar to the first go latice, this run had an initial energy that was high but eventually settled to -24 and stayed there.
